# Reinforcement Learning Factor Rotation

## Things we need to decide on:
- Do we want to compare against a benchmark
- What observation space we want to use
- How do we backtest/step to next outcome

## Data:
- Few simple factor etfs as the investment space
- Store a simple data frame as data feed

## Tasks:

Tasks and open todos can be seen in the [Projects section](https://github.zhaw.ch/davidjaggi/rl-factor-rotation/projects/1).
